## Ephesians 4:11-13 (NIV)
So Christ himself gave the **apostles**, the **prophets**,
the **evangelists**, the **pastors and teachers**,

to equip his people for **works of service**,
so that the body of Christ may be **built up**

until we all reach **unity in the faith**
and in the **knowledge** of the Son of God
and become **mature**, attaining to the whole measure
of the **fullness** of Christ.
